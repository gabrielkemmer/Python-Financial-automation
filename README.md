# Automatic Bill Sending Program via Gmail - Python-Financial-automation

This repository contains a program built with Python, Google Gmail API, Pandas, os, and Excel that automates 
the process of sending bills through Gmail. The program leverages the power of these technologies to read bill information 
from an Excel file, generate personalized emails, and send them via Gmail.

Technologies Used

Python
Python is a versatile and widely used programming language known for its simplicity and readability. 
It provides extensive libraries and frameworks that make it suitable for various tasks. In this project, Python serves 
as the core programming language for implementing the logic and interacting with the required APIs and libraries.

Google Gmail API
Google Gmail API provides programmatic access to Gmail, enabling developers to read, send, and manage emails. 
It allows sending emails, adding attachments, and interacting with Gmail's features. In this project, the Gmail API is used to 
send bills as email attachments.

Pandas
Pandas is a popular data manipulation and analysis library for Python. It provides powerful tools for reading, writing, and processing 
data, particularly in tabular form. In this project, Pandas is used to read bill information from an Excel file and perform data 
manipulation if necessary.

os
The os module in Python provides a way to interact with the operating system. It allows accessing file paths, executing system commands, 
and performing various file operations. In this project, the os module is used for file operations, such as locating the Excel file and 
managing file paths.

Excel
Excel is a widely used spreadsheet program that allows users to create and manage data in tabular form. In this project, 
Excel is used as the data source, where the bill information is stored in a structured manner. The program reads the necessary data 
from the Excel file to generate personalized bill emails.
